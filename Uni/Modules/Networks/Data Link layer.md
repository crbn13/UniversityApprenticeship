## MAC layer
One of the sublayers of the data link layer is the MAC layer

The MAC layer stores [[MAC Addresses]] and also is responsible for data encapsulation ([[Networking Frame]]) and "accessing the media" which means that it supports multiple physical communication types?

#### Broadcasting
The [[MAC Addresses]] change to set values when different [[#Broadcasting]] types are used because the destination [[MAC Addresses]] is not going to a single device so it is not set
