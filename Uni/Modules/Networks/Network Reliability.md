## Redundancy 
- Having multiple of each device so if one device breaks the other ones can maintain the connection 
- Cross connected network 
	- A sequential network means that if any device breaks, all connections will cease as every piece of data travels through the last 
	- Cross connected interconnects each redundant device

# Network architecture
# Fault tolerance
- Redundancy ? ability of a network to _tolerate_ faults with individual pieces of hardware
# Scalability
upgrading speed capability and bandwidth

# Quality of Service
Prioritising important connections over less important ones

# Network Security
