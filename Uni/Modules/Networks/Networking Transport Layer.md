The layer with TCP and UDP in it 

Transport for TCP

### What is it for?

breaking up large data into segments ( packets are the same size as frames as they are based on the largest frame size)

Managing different applications

Conversation Multiplexing 



## [[TCP]]
A protocol that establishes a connection that notifies notifies when a segment is not recieved

Abilities 
- Number and track segments sent
- acknowledge recieved data
- Retransmit any unacknowledged data 
- Sequence data that might arrive in the wrong order
- Send data at an efficient rate 

## [[UDP]]
No reliability, best effort delivery

No configrmation about packets that are sent and recieved
Used for real time data transfers like games, video, voice
No segment ordering

- Low overhead
- Fast
- lost data is not resent
- Delivers data as it arrives 


## Port Numbers

### Well known ports
are used to recieve connections on the server side
These range from 0 - 1023 and are for standards like http ssh sftp

### Registerd ports
Assigned by [[IANA]] for specific applications
Range : 1024-49151
-  

### Dynamic Ports
A range of ports that a client uses to recieve information? 
Used to identify the client application during communication 
Generated by the OS
range : 49152-65535

When clients create a connection a response port is created like 55323 and the request is sent from the local network out through that port
