128 bit addressing scheme.

## Address Representation 
The human readable format of [[ipv6]] consists of 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits separated by colons 
`    FFFF:EEEE:DDDD:CCCC:BBBB:AAAA:9999:8888    `

### Extra Rules
**Leading zeroes** can be omitted

so `:004b:` becomes `:4b:`

**Double colons** can represent any continuous chain of zeroes in the address. It can only be used once within the address to reduce ambiguity

So `fe80:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001` becomes `fe80::1` when using *both* rules

The colon rule can also be used on an entirely 0 ip6 address so
`0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000` becomes `::`


## Usage with [[ipv4]]
**Translation**
**Tunneling** 
**Dual Stack**


## Broadcasting
Ip6 does not have a broadcast address, instead uses anycast address which is an address which is used for sending data form the closest device?

## Addressing
**Global Unicast Address** GUA
This is similar to a public [[ipv4]] address 

**Link-Local Address** LLA
This is the equivalent of a ipv4 local ip, routers will not route these outside of the local network

Ipv6 always allocates 64 bits on the right to be the **Interface ID** 
Subnetting takes addresses from the left hand side of this 64 bit split like this:

ISPs commonly assign /48 addresses
The subnet id portion is for subnetting
then the interface id is for each different ip6 interface. Not each device because devices can have multiple ipv6 addresses 

In ipv6 the minimum and maximum addresses are not reserved, as there are no broadcast addresses, and the all 0's address can be used but it is reserved as a SubnetRouter anycast address 

## Dynamic addresses

Ipv6 enables dynamic allocation of GUA's via Router Advertisement RA and Router Solicitation RC messages


**RA message types**
Messages sent out by routers using [[ICMPV6]] messages
1. SLAAC - Router sends out all required information, including:
	1. prefix, prefix length, default gateway address 
2. SLAAC with a stateless [[DHCPv6]] server
	1. same info as SLAAC but tells host to get an DNS server address and Hostname from a stateless [[DHCPv6]] server
	2. The ip is still generated by the client
3. Stateful [[DHCPv6]] (no SLAAC)
	1. only tells host the default gateway address, everything else must be obtained from stateful dhcp server
	2. That dhcp server generates the Interface ID for the device

The client connects to the [[DHCPv6]] servers using dhcpv6 solicitation messages which it sends to all dhcpv6 servers on the network, asking for the additional information
The client generates its GUA interface ID using [[EUI-64]]?

## Multicasting
ff02::1 All Nodes multicast group
- This group is joined by all ipv6 enabled devices
ff02::2 All Routers multicast group
- this group is joined by all ipv6 enabled routers

Note, routers have to have ipv6 enabled as it is not enabled by default; cisco command: **ipv6 unicast-routing**
