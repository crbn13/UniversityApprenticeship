## Types of copper cabling
1. [[Unshielded Twisted-Pair UTP]]
2. [[Shielded Twisted-Pair STP]]
3. [[Coaxial]]

Twisted Pair wiring types
1. Straight Through
	1. Commonly used to connect a host to a switch and a switch to a router
	2. Used to connect 1 device type to another
2. Crossover
	1. Used to interconnect similar devices 
	2. like connecting a switch to a switch or a host to a host
	3. But modern NIC's can internally switch the wiring ([[Medium-Dependent interface crossover (auto-MDIX)]]) making crossover cables depreciated with modern hardware
3. Wiring ![[ethernet_cable_wiring_standards.png]]
	1. Straight through cable uses the same wiring on each RJ45 connector and crossover uses a different standard on each RJ45 cable


## Interference

Twisted pairs are used to decrease interference in UTP and STP
